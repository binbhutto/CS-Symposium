            </h2>
            <p class="mb-0 text-justify">It is not always necessary to solve a problem correctly, rather, the interviewer mainly focuses on the approach. Therefore, it is important to clearly demonstrate the approach used to the interviewer(s).<br><br>
              It is important for one to be updated with the trending technologies in order to survive in an industry and this is helpful for getting a job in FANG like companies. Some of the helpful tools include version control- Github etc., IDE-Eclipse etc. and unit testing. 
              Our speaker also highlighted importance of soft skills and how it helps us in connecting with the interviewers and also to get through an interview.<br><br>
              To applying for off-campus jobs, one needs to build a strong resume, register in job sites like LinkedIn, Naukri to stay updated and connected and build a good alumni connection.
              Our speaker also mentioned about the different types of companies - Product based companies and service based companies. The compensation as well as the work culture varies enormously. The software profiles are development, testing and operation. The prior knowledge of it is essential before stepping into an industry.
              The session had covered 90% of the skills one needs to develop in order to crack an interview to get into big companies. It was indeed an informative, insightful and successful event.
